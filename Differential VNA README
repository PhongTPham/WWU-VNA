The hardware files can be found at this repository:

https://github.com/PhongTPham/WWU-VNA These instructions were done an a Ubuntu Linux computer. They will vary slightly for Windows or OS X. The program can be run from Code Composer Studio or Energia.
Build Instructions:

Choose a designation , open the terminal and git clone the repository

    Install Code Composer Studio. (This works with CCS 8.2 and 9.0.)

    You need the MSP432 Red board library version 5.23.1 or later or you will have build errors.

    Install Energia, and using Energia's Tools->Boards:->Boards Manager, add the MSP432P401P (red board)

    Energia uses the Arduino way of handling libraries, and CCS knows how to import things. You should

    create folders for your libraries, the ones for this design are:

       adc14vna

       constants

       DynamicCommandParser

       si5351

       SignalProcessing

    You should then symbolically link these to the libraries present in the repositories library folders for Energia.

    Afterwards you should import Energia Sketch using File->Import...->Energia->Energia Sketch.
        Select MSP432P401R as the processor and install the correct board in board manager if needed (Energia)
        Right click on the project, and select add files.
            Add the .cpp, .c, and .h files.
            Under Build Settings->Miscellaneous->Miscellaneous C++ source specific flags add -fpermissive.

Usage:
CCS

    Click the hammer to build in CCS.
    After successfully compiling, click on the debug command
    Open CuteCom and type in commands for present in wwu_vna.ino

Energia

    To build in Energia, go to sketch and then upload.
    Then click on on tools to open up serial monitor and then type in the commands present in wuu_vna.ino with the respective parameters chosen at users discretion

wwu_vna.ino commands include:

For frequency sweep: "^SWEEP,Fmin,Fmax,NFreq$"

Returns single frequency measurements as a function of time:  "^TIME,Freq$"

Returns the sample rate:  "^SAMPLERATE,1=TIME/0=COMPUTE$"

Returns the dft around 155 HZ with a bin of about 10 HZ:  "^COMPUTE,Fs$"

To plot any of these Octave or Matlab can be used.
